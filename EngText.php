another wife, and married a widow, who had a daughter of her own. This widow was a Yagha Witch. The stepmother had a 
violent dislike for her stepdaughter. She used to strike her hard and gave her nothing to eat. One day she sent her to 
the waterhole to wash some old net. While the girl was washing it the swift current carried it away. She cried bitterly.
 Then she looked down the waterhole and saw a road. She descended and came to the lower world. She walked and walked, 
 and then saw a horse stable. Several horses stood in it, and the place was quite unclean. So she cleaned it well, 
 plucked some grass from under the snow among the tussocks, and brought it in for fresh litter. Then she continued on her way.',

When he failed to heal their disputes by his exhortations, he determined to give them a practical illustration of the evils of disunion; and for this purpose he one day told them to bring him a bundle of sticks. When they had done so, he placed the faggot into the hands of each of them in succession, and ordered them to break it in pieces. They tried with all their strength, and were not able to do it. He next opened the faggot, took the sticks separately, one by one, and again put them into his sons\' hands, upon which they broke them easily. He then addressed them in these words:

"My sons, if you are of one mind, and unite to assist each other, you will be as this faggot, uninjured by all the attempts of your enemies; but if you are divided among yourselves, you will be broken as easily as these sticks."'
